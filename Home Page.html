<h1>Week 1 - Introduction:</h1>
<p>Our journey began in Week 1, where we had the chance to meet our fellow team members. During this first class, we learned about the assignments that would shape our trimester. We went through the course structure to make sure everyone understood its key parts. We also took time to explore the tools and software we'd need for our assignments making sure we had them downloaded and or had accounts for them, making sure everyone felt ready for the tasks ahead.</p>

    <h1>Week 2 - Understanding Users:</h1>
    <p>In the second week, we dug even deeper into assignment 1. This is where we learned how to do more informed research. We also explored the idea of "personas" and how they work. These personas are like our design helpers, showing us the way. It made the assignment 1 more exciting as I had done similar in other classes, and I was really eager to get creative. With this new knowledge, I felt more prepared to dive into user-centred research with confidence. </p>

        <h1>Week 3 - Goals:</h1>
        <p>In the third week, we began to understand the power of working together as a team. It was during this time that we got to know how Venn diagrams can be really helpful. These diagrams showed us how to make our designs better by combining different ideas. This week's lessons were extra important because they gave us the tools to create designs that match exactly what our audience wants. Knowing all this stuff made it easier for us to work together as a team and make designs that people really like. So, it was like building a strong foundation for teamwork and designing things that users might like.</p>

            <h1>Week 4 - Journey Map and User Flow:</h1>
            <p>In the fourth week, we took a closer look at journey maps and user flow diagrams. Some of us already knew a bit about them, but it was nice to go over them again. It turned out to be fun and really helpful. Because I already knew some stuff about them, it was like fitting puzzle pieces together. I used these tools to make our designs work even better. This week made me feel more sure of myself when it came to creating designs that people can easily use. It's like we all added another layer to our design skills and made them even stronger.</p>

                <h1>Week 5 - Assignment 1 Support:</h1>
                <p>Week five was a bit shorter compared to our usual classes, and its main focus was on giving and receiving feedback. I felt pretty good about how my work was going by this point, so I didn't feel the need to ask for feedback. This was still a super important week. It was a chance for others to make their work even better and for all of us to share what we've learned so far. So, even though I didn't need feedback, I knew it was helping my classmates.</p>

                    <h1>Week 6 - Assignment 2.1 Brief: Color and Typography:</h1>
                    <p>During this class, we got a detailed explanation of what we needed to do for assignment 2.1. Since the mid-trimester break was getting closer, I wanted to make sure I got all the important details during this week. It was like the starting point for my project. I began creating the basic wireframes in shades of grey, kind of like the skeleton of my design. I started turning my ideas into something visual, thinking about things like colours and fonts to make sure the user experience would be great. It was like taking the first steps towards making my design.

                        <p>In the seventh week, something big happened, we turned in our assignment 2.1 projects! During the break, I spent a lot of time working on creating detailed wireframes that gave a real sense of what I had in mind for my design. I didn't just finish the home page; I also worked on the product page. Seeing my designs come together on the computer screen was super thrilling. It felt like a major achievement.</p>

                            <p>Week eight brought a new beginning after we wrapped up assignment 2.1. We all came back with fresh energy and enthusiasm, ready for what lay ahead in assignment 2.2. In this week's class, we talked about the first things we needed to do and set out the path we wanted to follow for this new project. It was like building the base for our upcoming design work, making everything clear and exciting again. Our creative spirits were reignited, and we were all pumped up to get started on this next phase of our design.</p>

                                <h1>Week 9 - Responsive Design and Labelling Files:</h1>
                                <p> Week 9 was all about something super important, responsive design. It's a big deal when it comes to our web projects. We talked about how our web pages need to work well on all sorts of devices and screen sizes. Plus, we got to share our experiences and talk about the tricky parts we faced while making things responsive. This week was like a crash course in the practical side of web development, getting us ready to tackle the challenges of creating websites that are user-friendly and look great on any device.</p>

                                    <h1>Week 10 - Assignment 2.2 Submission and Weekly Blog Summary:</h1>
                                    <p> Week ten was a really big deal because we handed in our assignment 2.2 projects. But that's not all,  we also got the lowdown on assignment 3. We looked at examples, like Shiv's work, to get an idea of what was expected for assignment 3 and the theory behind it all. So, it wasn't just about turning in our work; it was like preparing the ground for the next exciting part of our project. This week was a crucial step. </p>

                                        <p> Week eleven was pretty cool because we got to show off our work. This was a special chance for us to hear what others thought about our projects, especially when it came to turning our Figma website into a working CMS site. During this time, I also made my explanation of the project clearer. It wasn't just me, though; we all did it. We talked to each other about what we liked and didn't like in a friendly way. It was a really nice experience where we got to learn from each other, make our designs better, and become better designers together.</p>

                                            <p>Our last week was like tying up a bow on our entire course! We sat down for a big chat where we looked back on everything we'd learned and done. We talked about our favourite parts and what we hoped to do next. It was also a chance to say a big "Thank You!" to our awesome tutors who helped us all along the way. Plus, we talked about what we want to do in the world of web design in the year ahead.</p>
